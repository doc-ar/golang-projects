# Introduction

When I started learning GO language I did not understand where to start. However, I quickly understood that the best way to learn is to build stuff I am interested in. So This repository contains all the projects I have created while learning GO language. I will be adding seperate README files for each project. They are listed below.

# Prerequisites

For running and building any of these projects, you will need go installed. for linux distributions its a simple process of installing go using your package manager.

```
sudo pacman -S go
```

```
sudo apt-get install go
```

and that's about it.

> Project specific dependancies will be mentioned in their respected README files
